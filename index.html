Tested ZenPhone with Republic Wireless SIM, verified 4G works, need to verify SMS/MMS and voice call capabilities.

# 2019.08.29 Changelog
Met with documentation lead to discuss path forward.  
Obtained buy-in for infrastructure offering meta, deferred prototype selection to end-of-day.  

Load balancer spec agreed upon, as a precursor for any/all auto-scaling infrastructure.

Added numeric flag to functions.sh `com/namer.sh` subfunction.  
@todo - update defaults for `com/namer.sh` to length of 5, with numeric division for clarity.
(possible combinations from these defaults increase from `392882600736521` (`73241*73241*73241`) to `3.92882600736521e16` (`73241*10*73241*10*73241`), which is...probably excessive, but format of `numberal3split5words` is easier to remember, and the function will be used to name the automated infrastructure)

Submitted [vultr-cli PR](https://github.com/vultr/vultr-cli/pull/47), based on difficulties encountered when switching from Debian (remote) dev to OSX local dev.

Created Github org for Rheos One.  
Need to get profile IDs for team members.
