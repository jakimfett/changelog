			# 2019.08.30
			Met with prospective editor, as well as a future scientist.

			Discussed launch loop project with documentation lead, created diagrams for explaining cross section and landing/energy/control mechanisms.

			Extended conversation into the truth mapper, along with a deep dive into project governance and the process of relinquishing control.

			Identified three potential developers for the project, two backend primaries and one frontend primary, and established LaTeX as the 'publishing' documentation paradigm, with Markdown and Dia used for development and graphical representation of information, respectively.

			Tested ZenPhone with Republic Wireless SIM, verified 4G works, need to verify SMS/MMS and voice call capabilities.

			# 2019.08.29 Changelog
			Met with documentation lead to discuss path forward.
			Obtained buy-in for infrastructure offering meta, deferred prototype selection to end-of-day.

			Load balancer spec agreed upon, as a precursor for any/all auto-scaling infrastructure.

			Added numeric flag to functions.sh `com/namer.sh` subfunction.
			@todo - update defaults for `com/namer.sh` to length of 5, with numeric division for clarity.
			(possible combinations from these defaults increase from `392882600736521` (`73241*73241*73241`) to `3.92882600736521e16` (`73241*10*73241*10*73241`), which is...probably excessive, but format of `numberal3split5words` is easier to remember, and the function will be used to name the automated infrastructure)

			Submitted [vultr-cli PR](https://github.com/vultr/vultr-cli/pull/47), based on difficulties encountered when switching from Debian (remote) dev to OSX local dev.

			Created Github org for Rheos One.
			Need to get profile IDs for team members.
