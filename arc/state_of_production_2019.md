In 2019, we intentionally set ourselves on the path towards leadership.

As individuals of Jewish heritage, First Nations ancestry, and marginalized existence, our privilege, and our duty, is to make use of every tool at our disposal to resist.

We, with means of production and anger in our bones, cannot stand idly by while "Never Again" rings hollow through the growing number of detainment centres and concentration camps. 

And between engineering and finance,  
business is a powerful tool indeed.

We do this for our family, found and blood alike.  
We do this for our ourselves, self-development and manifestation.  
We do this for freedom of production.

In 2019, we formally began the upward climb towards becoming a governmentally-recognized cooperative. Our mission, and our core goals, have always been collaborative, but receiving a tax break for the stuff we refurbish and give away would be nice, too.

Anger towards the individuals who could personally fix worldwide problems without affecting profits is at an all time high.

We briefly considered attempting to Leverage some 1%ers, but the risk of being prosecuted for something that personal by [a system designed to cater to the whims of the wealthy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B) seemed unwise, so we'll make our profits the hard way (by marketing to the wealthy).

Profiteering for the marginalized is our methodology and intent, until our efforts undermine capitalism with a system that works *better* are met with success.

In 2019, we soft-launched the [DarkPi project](https://darkpi.com/) on distributed social media. 


Looking ahead to 2022:
We will be self-employed, and in small business at the place where our [Grandfather](https://jakimfett.com/grandpa-marvin/) once upon a time taught us the fundamentals of manufacturing.

Support our [Patreon](https://patreon.com/jakimfett), the [Kaelar Family KoFi](https://ko-fi.com/kaelars/), or the [Thorn Valley Reclaim LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/tvrp/) for early access to efforts towards a sustainable, distributed means of production.
