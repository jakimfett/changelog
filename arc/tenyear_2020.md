The last ten years, a retrospective.

In 2010, I helped a friend move to escape an abusive ex.  

By 2019, it feels like I need to do that, but for the entire planet, except for the fascists, and neo-nazis, and colonizers, and other abusers.

We traveled less than the previous decade, but learned more.

We found out who our friends are, and who was using us for knowledge, information, or expertise.

We ran out of spoons a lot more.  
Chronic depression reinforced by PTSD, laced with a toxic mismedication, caused us significant delay in accomplishing lasting work.

We found friends in unlikely places.

We found love, light, and community.

In this decade, Tessa L. H. Lovelace was forged, honed, and refined.

War is the default in this world, my friend.  
There were zero days without large scale conflict in this decade.  
If this is your first contact with humanity, flee now and live.  

And if this reaches you, and our festering toxicity has spilled into the stars...

...then we have failed to contain the menace of capitalism.

Life under late-stage capitalism is a difficult struggle for the privileged but un-wealthy, and a path of marginal difficulty and easy escape from responsibility and consequences for the ones with wealth to spare.

This decade saw the rise of poverty, homelessness, and the ultra-rich.

The billionaires, ones who take wealth to excess, excess to glut, glut to obscenity, and obscenity to abomination.

Individuals who could, without adversely affecting their profit margins or bottom line, fix systemic inequalities on a global, planetary scale, who possess the means of production and control, and choose to do nothing but maximize profit.

We saw the rise of the people, this decade.

We saw that the needle can be moved by an individual with conviction and support.

We saw that monsters can be individual and insidious.
